## Introduction
The **Churn Analysis Project** aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The project analyzes customer data from a telecom company and builds models to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or stay.

This project follows the typical machine learning pipeline:
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset, which contains information about customers and their usage behavior, including:
- **Demographic details** (e.g., gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents)
- **Services** (e.g., PhoneService, InternetService, OnlineSecurity)
- **Account information** (e.g., Contract type, Payment method, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)
- **Churn**: The target variable, indicating whether a customer churned or not.
